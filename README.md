#Hotwriting

This repo contains the source code for [Hotwriting](http://toddwords.itch.io/hotwriting), a book of playable digital poems by Todd Anderson. 

This code is free to use under the MIT license, so please feel free to copy it as the basis of your own projects. Some of it is more gnerously commented than others, but I'll be working on cleaning it up over time to better function as an education resource.

If you have any questions about implementing any of this source code, please feel free to contact me at toddwords@gmail.com
