<!--  <h1>Letter Home</h1>
<p>Dear Mom,</p>
<p>I know you are worried about me because of what happened here, so I wanted to write you to let you know that I am alive.</p>
<p>The stories on the news are only the tip of the iceberg</p>
<p>No one is allowed to leave.</p>
<p>My university has closed down because more than half the professors have been thrown in jail.</p>
<p>So I have been relocated out of the city and am now being held in a Soviet-era detention center run by the new government.</p>
<p>Most of the other detainees are foreign nationals like me.Hopefully we will be able to communicate with one of the embassies before long.</p>
<p>I'm scared, Mom. I don't know what they're going to do with us.</p>
<p>I wish I was home with you, Dad and Lisa.</p>
<p>They say I can email you once a week. I will write again as soon as I can.</p>
<p>Love,<br>Jeremy</p> -->
