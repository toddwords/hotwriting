	<legend>Hotwriting Instructions</legend>
	<p>Hey welcome and thanks for checking this out. <em>Hotwriting</em> is a book of sorts but you don't read it the way your would a normal book/epub/web article. Every piece in this book is going to require of some measure of interaction on your part in order to access (read/see/hear) the text. You will press keys on your keyboard and all sorts of words and noises and animated gifs will pop out This will usually go one of two ways:</p>
	<ol>
<li><strong>Linear Order:</strong> Most of the pieces in this book are written with a somewhat linear order in mind, which you can play by pressing <strong>Space</strong> repeatedly, to see each subsequent line. If a piece says 'Press Space to Begin' it is a linear piece.<br />However, these pieces can also be remixed, and played as instruments or soundboards. The lines of the piece will always be mapped to individual keys in the following order:<br />q w e r t y u i o p [ ] \<br />a s d f g h j k l ; '<br />z x c v b n m , . / <br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =<br />After (or while) you go through the piece linearly, try pressing keys in different orders, pressing the same key over and over, or multiple keys at once. There are a bunch of different fun ways to play these pieces and I hope you'll discover something you like.</li>
<li><strong>Any Key:</strong> In this mode you can press keys in any order. Often the keys will not be connected to specific pieces of text, but rather certain sound or images that will create the atmosphere around the text as it unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>Other:</strong> There will be some pieces that will not fit into either of these models, they will give you more specific instructions in the piece itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two final notes: <ol><li>these pieces often look best in full screen mode (F11 on PC, Command+Shift+F on Mac)</li><li>if something feels broken or not working right try refreshing the page and waiting a few seconds.</li></ol></p> <p>Ok that's enough instructions time to get started by heading over to the <a href="../toc/index.html">Table of Contents.</a></p>
