I have this idea about writing where I want it to feel the same way going out as it does coming in. Like I don't know what's going to happen. Like I'm only kind of in control. Like I am hanging on the shag-hairs of some mythical poembeast as it gallops. Reading a poem on a computer screen or even a book rarely feels like this to me. I want reading to feel more like playing the electric guitar. I want writing to feel more like playing the electric guitar.</em><br><br><strong style="float:right">-T.S.

Poetry is in a weird spot in the age of browsing and diminished attention spans. On the one hand poems are short, people are reading shorter and shorter things, for less time. Awesome, should be a good time for poems. On the other hand, people are less willing to think hard about a chunk of text and are more likely to get distracted if they don't get it right away, sounds like a bad time for poems. It is a goodbad time for poems.</p>
<p>
What is poetry? We know it existed before writing and meant something different once there was a printing press and something different once you didn't have to write in iambic pentameter, and I would hazard the assertion that poetry doesn't necessarily have anything to do with line breaks or layouts of text printed inside rectangles of various analog and light-emitting materials. But I don't really care what it is, let's talk about what it does. How it makes language stick to your tongue like a Werther's Original. How it makes you feel something. How it talks to your secret inside voice. How it excites you and makes you uncomfortable and polishes your heart until it is glossy.</p>

<marquee scrollamount="10">I just want to do what poetry does with every tool at my disposal and I want you to let me, because sad rectangles of text on the internet bum me out and maybe they bum you out too.</marquee>

<p>--<br><br>
I started coding around the same time I started writing poetry (early college). I learned to code through a freelance copywriting gig writing text ads for online casinos through an ad agency based in the Czech Republic. I was their only native English speaker. I got paid by the ad, which meant I could give myself a raise if I found ways to write faster (quality wasn't really an issue). So I taught myself AutoHotKey, a scripting language for the PC that, among other things, let me type the html hyperlinks for the website I was advertising in two keystrokes instead of twenty. This remained my job throughout college and I learned more and more programming tricks to keep automating faster and faster.</p>
<p>I first started to combine creative writing and code in May of 2013. A friend asked me to improvise a poem on a projector while he played electronic drum music. As we practiced, I couldn't type fast enough to make my ideas keep up with the music, but then it occurred to me that I could write a script to type a whole word, phrase or even sentence off of a single keypress. D for 'dance', P for 'party,' dance party dance party dance party dance party <('-'<) (>'-')> (^'0')^ ^('0'^) <('-'<) (>'-')> (v'-') ('-'v)<('-'<) ^('0'^)</p>  
<p>Since that time I have been exploring the potential of this new medium which I call "hotwriting," short for hotkey-macro-generated-writing. Binding lines of poetry to individual keys allows me to remix on the fly, repeat key lines, hold for laughter and change forms without warning. I can sync a text to a recording of me reading those lines (or text to speech),  match images to lines, build soundscapes as the poem unfolds, replace text as it is being typedâ€¦a lot of things really, some of which I'm still figuring out.</p>
<p>A film analogy seems appropriate. Somewhere in the scene let's assume there is a nugget of truth that is trying to be conveyed, could be a characters feeling or a line of dialogue, but there is much more going on than just that one thing. There are camera shots and sound design and sets and it is all choreographed, managing your attention, guiding your mood, so you will understand a certain thing in a certain way. Why shouldn't we try to take a similar approach with language, now that we can? Using all the tools at our disposal to guide the reader's attention, we can set up a mood, put the audience in the mindset to best receive an idea or understand a sentiment. This is more and more how I think about writing these days. I'm not just responsible for the words but how you feel when you read them.</p>
<p>All of the pieces collected in this volume started out as performances for crowds at improv theaters or Lower East Side cocktail lounges. I perform by hooking up my computer to a projector then standing next to the screen wearing a wireless keyboard on a rope around my neck, which I use to type at the audience and control the pieces. Developing these pieces as performances first has been immensely helpful, to improve their accessibility (you never know who will show up at a reading) and for their energy. However it does create a challenge: how do I perform them for you if I'm not there?</p>
<p>This is a tricky question because so much of hotwriting is about controlling the reading experience. In a performance setting this is easy because I can control most/all of your sensory inputs, but it's a little tougher when I leave you to your own devices where the things I say will inevitably trundle through some pile of technology and the habits those technologies engender and I don't want to just leave the applesauce in a bowl on the counter, I want to put the applesauce on to the airplane and fly around in the airplane until you open the hangar and then fly the airplane into the hangar. It is important to me that it is my airplane. I don't want you eating my applesauce out of Google's self-driving space-car or Facebook's weird weather balloon. But wait, if I'm not there who's going to fly my weird shitty javascript airplane? Who has the...who can...*gasp* it's you. It has to be you.</p>
<p>This is where it gets exciting. I can control so many things about your experience of these pieces, but I can't control you. In most cases I have written a poem and I have given you the tools to read it but also the tools to not read it or read it wrong and think I'm a bad poet or a bad web poem designer. And let me tell you it's so tempting to make it so you just have to go through it the way I wrote it or the way I perform it because let's be honest what if you do a bad job? Neither of us wants that, I certainly don't want that for you. Maybe you should just take it easy and press Space for a while? Are you getting angry at me? I hope so, I want you to angrily break my poems even though it might make me feel bad: I think it's important that you push my boundaries like this. I think it's important that you fuck around.</p>
<p>And so we reach the uneasy double-nature of this "book": both a set of interactive websites that you "play" and a long text document that you "read." I of course privilege the digital experience, but also wonder-if/hope this document will be useful to you. I want you to see the text of the pieces without all their mediated elements and measure to what extent they still hold up. And at the end, I want you to take a little closer look at the code that makes all of it run and understand its power and how you might make something like this yourself. To borrow a phrase from John Cayley, in my case the code is not the text, but it is the medium and still rewarding to understand.</p>

OK, time to end this introduction with a few words on the future or maybe an "INSPIRATIONAL JOKE." So what does the future hold? Hard to say really: there's not much of a model for paying for any sort of writing on the internet much less paying for non-standardized, ad-unfriendly, interactive work. But I have hope. Let me describe my hope for the future in terms of a junior high school math class word problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Q:</strong> If the Buzzfeed Express leaves Clickbait City at a speed of 0.15 ideas/pageview and the ELO Shuttle departs Academia at a speed of 8 working artists/conference what will happen when they collide?</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>A:</strong> Both trains will explode leaving a beautiful wreckage of culture spanning the spectrum of approachability and intellectual rigor with weird little niche communities forming around the fused hull-parts of the two megatrains and a new, sturdier public transportation network coming into being to connect them and bring in new settlers and tourists alike. Partial credit if no public transportation system connecting the communities, no credit if wreckage is not beautiful.</p>
<p>
I guess that's all I want, I want there to be enough beautiful works of digital language out there by enough different kinds of people that everyone can find something they really love. I guess all I want is for you to love my book. <em><strong>And believe in yourself.</em></strong></p>
